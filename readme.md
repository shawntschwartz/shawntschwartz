### hey there, i'm shawn 👋

i'm a cognitive neuroscience phd candidate at the [stanford memory lab](https://memorylab.stanford.edu/) in sunny palo alto, ca. my research investigates the neural mechanisms underpinning lapses in sustained attention, and how these lapses relate to episodic memory performance. i'm also currently one of the resident stats consultants in the [stanford department of psychology](https://psychology.stanford.edu).

before stanford, i completed my master's and bachelor's degrees at ucla (go bruins!) in [computational biology](https://michaelalfaro.github.io/alfaro-lab/) where I worked on [high-throughput](https://besjournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/2041-210X.13712) pipelines to facilitate large-scale analyses of phenotype, in addition to research in [human memory and education](https://castel.psych.ucla.edu).
